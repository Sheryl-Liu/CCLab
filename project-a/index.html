                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Resonant Ripple does not have a so-called family, as it is ripple, itself is a whole family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Our Resonant Ripple lives under the huge colorful sky where, we, human-beings are. Wherever people are
                    there is the habitat of Resonant Ripple. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Resonant Ripple looks just like its name: ripple. We would describe it as a puddle-formed creature, that
                    fluctuates over and over again. The beginning form of this little creature looks exactly like a circle
                and is rippling over time, waiting for your moods and will dramatically respond to your current mood and 
                change to a diverse form based on your emotion!</p>
                <p>But anyways, it is a circle based ripple and the fluctuations are around its edges.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changeable: Highly responsive to all kinds of moods and it adapts to reflect 
                        what you're feeling.</li>
                    <li>Supportive: Always present to offer comfort, reminding you that youâ€™re never alone. 
                        It truly cares about you!.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                In the year 4202, Sheryl Liu, a great scientist, made a remarkable discovery under the colorful sky. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Resonant Ripple defied traditional classifications of life, as it appeared to be a puddle-formed entity that lived 
                wherever human beings gathered. It constantly fluctuates, mimicks the feelings of people who interact with it or around 
                it. Each ripple and wave emanating from its edge reflects the emotional state of the interactor. For example, when 
                someone feels angry, the Resonant Ripple will feel it too and change its color into red and "dance" with lines around
                it; when sadness prevails, it morphs into soothing, gentle hues and shaking with you if you "touch" it...  
                <br>
                <br>
                This responsiveness to human emotion has led many to believe that the Resonant Ripple possesses an innate 
                understanding of feelings, almost as if it were an empathic being.
                <br>

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                <br>
                When human-beings interact with it, tell it your mood by clicking on the cute buttons on the screen; then, you will see the 
                immediate changes in our little Resonant Ripple that resonant with your feelings rapidly. If you ever "touch" it,
                by pressing the mouse in reality, you will see the further expression of this kind and caring creature.
                <br>
                <br>
                Little Myth: Once upon a time, on a dim evening, there was a man who sat by the water, a quiet lakeside, reflecting on 
                his troubles. And suddenly, a Ripple appeared, glowing softly in the fading light. When he found the creature changing 
                its format alongside his mood, he poured out his heart to the creature. As he did, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief 
                wash over him as if the Ripple had absorbed his pain.
